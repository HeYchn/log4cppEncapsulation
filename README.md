# log4cppEncapsulation  
### What is log4cpp?  
Log4cpp is a very powerful and flexible library for c++ logging, you can learn more about or download it at [log4cpp](http://log4cpp.sourceforge.net/).  
    
### What I did?  
These works are mainly to encapsulate the log4cpp so as you can use it just easily as *printf()*.  

eg.  

    LogInfo("hello, log4cpp %d %s", 111, info);  
    
    2018-07-13 18:29:22,037 [INFO ] [test.cpp -> main -> line 8] hello log4cpp 111 info
